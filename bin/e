# Quick shortcut to an editor.
#
# This means that as I travel back and forth between editors, hey, I don't have
# to re-learn any arcane commands. Neat.
#
# USAGE:
#
#   $ e
#   # => opens the current directory in your editor
#
#   $ e .
#   $ e /usr/local
#   # => opens the specified directory in your editor

if [ -z "$1" ]; then

  # Start - sublime specific setting
  projectfile=`ls -1 ./*.sublime-project 2>/dev/null | head -1`
  if [ -z "$projectfile" ]; then
    exec $EDITOR_BG .
  else
    echo "Opening $projectfile"
    echo "Use \"e .\" if you want to see the whole folder instead"
    exec $EDITOR_BG "$projectfile"
  fi
  # End - sublime specific setting

  exec $EDITOR_BG "$1"
